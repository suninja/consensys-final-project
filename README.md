# consensys-final-project
My Consensys course - final project - 10/nov/2021


Hi! I'm suninja and this is my idea for the final project at Blockchain Bootcamp 2021 ;)

Description:
The idea is that two or more people decide to upload a 'snapshot of their lives' together (called 'mémoires´). 
That photo will be digital, unique and will remain in the Blockchain forever.
It will be a real unique photogallery that you decide to chronologically be at your disposals or those who love you and wanna check your lifetime ;)

Possible name for the dApp - Mémoire Gallery (MeGallery)

Workflow:
1. A user takes a photo. 
2. When initializing the dApp, a SmartContract will be created. 
3. Users will log there somewhow.
4. One user will upload a photo that will be unique and remain forever!
5. All users sharing that life snapshot will pay the 'fee'.
6. When fee + photo is uploaded then the requirements are met. The info is added to the SmartContract.
7. A NFT is created with the 'life snapshot' or 'mémoire'. The info included will be listed below
   7.1 Photo
   7.2 Location
   7.3 Participants sharing the moment
8. The NFT / SmartContract is executed which means, that the info will be part of the Blockchain forever.
